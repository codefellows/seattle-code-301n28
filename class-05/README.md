## Notes

- What is conditional rendering?
  - it is the logic that determines what content is rendered to the page based off some condition.

- What is `react-router-dom`?
  - [`react-router-dom` v6 Docs](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/getting-started/overview)
  - [`react-router-dom` v5 Docs](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/guides/primary-components)
    - these are the docs for v5 which is not compatible with React v18.
    - The v5 docs are helpful in breaking down some of the common components, their jobs and how to implement them.
  - source of all `react-router-dom` truth: <https://github.com/remix-run/react-router>

- What is Browser Router?
  - At the core of every React Router application should be a router component. For web projects, react-router-dom provides `<BrowserRouter>` and `<HashRouter>` routers. The main difference between the two is the way they store the URL and communicate with your web server.
      - A `<BrowserRouter>` uses regular URL paths. These are generally the best-looking URLs, but they require your server to be configured correctly. Specifically, your web server needs to serve the same page at all URLs that are managed client-side by React Router. Create React App supports this out of the box in development, and comes with instructions on how to configure your production server as well.

- What is Router?
  - To use a `<Router>`, just make sure it is rendered at the root of your element hierarchy. Typically youâ€™ll wrap your top-level `<App>` element in a router.
    - In terms of React, `<Router>` is a [context provider](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html#contextprovider) that supplies routing information to the rest of the app. That just means that it rerenders the React app when something within the `<Router>` changes.

- What is Routes?
  - Routes replaced the Switch in v5
      - V6 is a lot smarter and will pick the Route with the most specific match so you don't have to worry about ordering inside the Switch anymore.
      - Routes is a parent element to hold all the app's nested `<Route/>` components.

- What is Route?
  - A Route's job is to render some Component when its path matches the current URL.
    - You can think of a `<Route>` component as a "page" in your app.
    - If the current URL endpoint is `/bananas`, this route is rendered while the rest are ignored.

- What is Routing?
  - A link that switches content.
  - When clicked, a link will render a component in a spot on the page.
  - Can change out a single component within a page.
  - Or, it can can switch out a full page of content.

1. A ternary statement:

  ```javaScript
  // regular if/else conditional
  if(conditionIsTrue){
    return 'it is true'
  } else {
    return 'it is false'
  }

  // ternary statement
  return conditionIsTrue ? 'it is true' : 'it is false';
  ```

1. Conditionally render a component:

  ```javaScript
  class Parent extends React.Component {
    constructor(props){
      super(props);
      this.state={
        displayChild: false
      }
    }

    render() {
      return(
        // use a ternary to conditionally render the Child component
        {this.state.displayChild ?
          <Child>
        : ''
        }
      )
    }
  }
  ```

- A better way to write it would be:

  ```javaScript
  class Parent extends React.Component {
    constructor(props){
      super(props);
      this.state={
        displayChild: false
      }
    }

    render() {
      return(
        {this.state.displayChild &&
          <Child>
        }
      )
    }
  }
  ```

## Feedback Overview
- "I am getting used to the pace of the class and keeping up with the assignments."
- "I like this class and the way we are working through different methods in ES6."
- "I like how we use repelit, I think that is a very handy tool, That sets the student up for actual practice in the topic that is being studied. The code challenge and then being able to pull the notes down and even have access to the repelit, That has been a game changer for me"
- "Im getting my butt kicked but im enjoying it."
- "My only concern is finding a job upon graduation. I'm already networking and doing targeted job searches, and I love the career assignments we have. I feel like they are preparing me well. I would however, like more support from Code Fellows in making connections with recruiters."

  - <http://hired.codefellows.org/>
- "I feel energized for class!"
- "I dislike React and React-Bootstrap."
- "Honestly just wish I had more hours in the day haha. I had a great week and feel like I'm getting a lot out of the course."
- "I think I'd like to know more about reading expectations in the course-- there were a lot of bookmark and review items in the assignment from earlier this week. Are we also expected to parse through those documents, or is it for our own wanting-to-learn-more journey? I do really appreciate them, just want to know if not reading them will affect what we glean from lecture/class time."
- "It has definitely been fast paced and learning how to work with React components has been a lot to take in. It is taking me more time to understand how everything works."
