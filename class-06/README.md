## Notes

- What does WRRC stand for?
  - Web Request Response Cycle
- What are HTTP methods?
  - Developers use HTTP methods to access APIs.
  - GET: requests data from a server
  - POST: sends new information to a server
  - PUT: makes changes to existing data on a server
  - DELETE: removes existing information from a server
  - PATCH: used for partial updates
  - There are more methods than these 5, but these are the most popular
- What is asynchronous code and how does it relate to async and await?
  - You don't know how long the API will take to respond, so when the script runs the next line it will throw an error because the response is not yet available.
  - Instead, you need your code to wait until the response is returned before it tries to do anything else to it.
  - Many Web API features now use asynchronous code to run, especially those that access or fetch some kind of resource from an external device, such as fetching a file from the network, accessing a database and returning data from it, accessing a video stream from a web cam, or broadcasting the display to a VR headset.
- What is synchronous code?
  - The script runs some code, the lines are executed one after the other and the result is returned as soon as the browser can do so
    - While each operation is being processed, nothing else can happen
    - rendering is paused
    - This is because JavaScript is single threaded.
    - Only one thing can happen at a time, on a single main thread, and everything else is blocked until an operation completes.
- What is `async` and `await`?
  - "async and await make promises easier to write"
  - `async` makes a function return a Promise
  - `await` tells a function where to wait for a Promise
  - <https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_async.asp>
- What is an API?
  - Application Programming Interface
  - It allows two applications to communicate with one another to access data.
  - An API is essentially a messenger that takes requests, translates, and returns responses.
  - The internet is full of third-party APIs who will happily give us their information as long as we ask for it in the correct way and follow their rules (ie - some require special keys, some require that we provide a link back to them... etc...). How do we know what their rules are? We have to read their documentation and every one of them is different!
  - Collecting information from these APIs is not instantaneous. We have to wait to get to get the data back. This is why we `async` and `await`: to tell JavaScript to wait for the data to come back.
- Why do you need an API key?
  - An API key is a unique identifier used to authenticate a user, developer, or calling program to an API
      - It is used to track number of requests made by a particular app to avoid Denial of Service attack and also for premium features. eg: only 500 calls per day for free account and to make more calls you have to subscribe to their premium account.
      - API Key is included in headers or URL of the request
- What is Axios?
  - Resource: <https://axios-http.com/docs/intro>
  - This is our "carrier pigeon" that carries our request to the server/API.
  - According to their docs: Axios is a promise-based HTTP Client for node.js and the browser. It is isomorphic (= it can run in the browser and nodejs with the same codebase). On the server-side it uses the native node.js http module, while on the client (browser) it uses XMLHttpRequests.
  - Features: Make XMLHttpRequests from the browser; Make http requests from node.js; Supports the Promise API; Intercept request and response; Transform request and response data; Cancel requests; Automatic transforms for JSON data; Client side support for protecting against XSRF
- What is an HTTP API Client?
  - Resource: <https://www.thunderclient.io/>
  - According to their docs: Hand-crafted lightweight HTTP Client for Testing APIs
  - It is useful for testing the API for the data that you can get back
- What is the purpose of an `.env` file?
  - is to hide your most important/secret values/variables.
  - env is short for "enviroment" variables
  - we are going to use the `.env.` file to hide our secret API key from the internet
  - `.env.` file is going to be added to the `.gitignore` file and will therefore be ignored by git when ACPing to GitHub.
- What are Netlify's Enviroment Variables used for?
  - these variables are the exact same variables and values that can be found inside your `.env` file.

1. Making a variable in an .env file: `PORT=3000`

   - Common ways to get that wrong:
     - Spaces around the `=`
     - Adding a semicolon at the end of the line
     - Using something other than UPPERCASE

1. Making an API call:

   ```javascript
   import React from 'react';
   import axios from 'axios';

   class App extends React.Component {
     // Because it takes an unknown amount of time to get the information, we need to do an async and await in this function:
     getPokemon = async () => {
       // This will go to the Pokemon API and GET us a bunch of pokemon objects.
       // The 'await' says: "Don't run the next line until I get back with the information that you asked for and then put it in a const called 'pokemon'."
       const pokemonResponse = await axios.get('https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon');

       // axios returns a big object. The part of that object that has the pokemon in it is the .data attribute of the object.
       const pokemonArray = pokemonResponse.data;
     }

     render() {
       return(
         <button onClick={this.getPokemon}>Get Pokemon</button>
       )
     }
   }
   ```

1. Using a try/catch for error handling:

   ```javascript
   getPokemon = async () => {
     try{
       const pokemon = await axios.get('https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon');
       const pokemonArray = pokemon.data;
     } catch(err) {
       console.error(err);
     }
   }
   ```

   - you can wrap a try/catch around any code you want
   - it says, "try to run this code - if it doesn't work, then run the code in the catch block"
